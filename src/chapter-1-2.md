The purpose of this book is to explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and intelligent technologies in modern warfare. The use of AI in military operations has become increasingly prevalent in recent years, with a growing number of countries investing in intelligent systems for a range of applications, including unmanned vehicles, autonomous weapons systems, and decision support tools.

The goal of this book is to provide a comprehensive overview of the different types of AI technologies being used in military operations today, as well as the potential benefits and risks associated with their use. We will examine case studies in which intelligent systems have been deployed in real-world military scenarios, and explore the ethical and legal considerations that arise when using AI in warfare.

In addition, this book will examine the likely future trajectory of AI in military operations, including emerging technologies and their potential impact on the battlefield. We will consider the implications of the increasing use of autonomous systems, and explore the challenges and opportunities presented by the continued integration of human and machine decision-making in military operations.

Ultimately, the purpose of this book is to provide a comprehensive resource for military strategists, policymakers, and researchers who are seeking to understand the current state of AI in military operations, and to envision the future direction of intelligent technologies in warfare. By examining the latest developments in this rapidly evolving field, we hope to provide insights and guidance for optimizing the use of intelligent systems in military contexts, while minimizing the risks and ethical considerations that arise with their deployment.
